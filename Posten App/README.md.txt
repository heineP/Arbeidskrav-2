Posten App

Status: Finished/Functional
- Changes can be made to support multiple Json files.
- Changes can be made to create a new text document when running the program, rather than overwriting the old results.
- Can maybe make the program more robust by editing privacy of a bunch of methods/fields.
- Can maybe make the program more robust by only allowing method CalculateOptimalPackageInfo() to be run 1 time per instance.

How to use:
1. Place Json file you want calculated in "Posten App/Posten App/Jsonfiles".
2. It is important that the Json file is named "items" in lowercase, and placed in the correct folder.
3. Run Posten App.exe in "bin/debug/net8.0" with no arguments. The exe file MUST be run from that folder path. 
4. Results will be printed in the console and copied into "Posten App/Posten App/Results.txt".

Task interpretation:
- In spec 2: "Eske Norgespakke" will be chosen over all "Posten Box" types, if possible.
